# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About
PhoneLink (Phonelink.tech) is a real-time software that lets you share text between devices with just your browser

It was developed by Charan Sriram and uses Firebase as a backend/React for the front-end. 


# How to use

PhoneLink is simple to use. On one device, click the sign-in button and select a Google account to use. This will automatically create a room that's active while your window is open.

On the next device, enter your code (you may have to leave the room if you're in one).

That's it! Any text typed in the box should appear on both devices in real-time.
